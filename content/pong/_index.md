## Goal

In this running example we are going to

- implement a __distributed__ version of the classic game Pong
- in [Python](https://www.python.org)
- using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org)

in order to exemplify the _development_ of a distributed system _project_.

## What is PyGame?

- **PyGame** is a popular Python library for writing simple games

- It handles many game development tasks, such as _graphics_, _sound_, _time_, and _input management_.

- Simple to use, yet powerful enough to create non-trivial games

- Lightweight, portable, and easy to install
    + `pip install pygame` (better to use a virtual environment)

## Preliminaries

# The Game Loop

---

## What is a Game Loop?

- A **game loop** is the main logic cycle of most video-games

- It continuously runs while the game is active, managing the following aspects:
    1. **Processing user input** (e.g., keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
    2. **Updating the game state** (e.g., moving objects in the virtual space)
    3. **Rendering the game** (e.g., drawing the game world on the screen)
    4. **Simulating the passage of time** in the game (e.g., moving objects even in absence of inputs)

- Most commonly, some _wait_ is introduced at the end of each cycle
    + to control the game's __frame rate__

#### Aspects to notice (cf. [PyGame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html)):

- PyGame comes with a notion of _events_ and __event queue__
    * this is good for handling user _inputs_

- each event has a _type_ (e.g., `pygame.KEYDOWN` and `pygame.KEYUP`) and _attributes_ (e.g., `event.key`)
    * there is a _class_ for events, namely `pygame.event.Event`
    * event _types_ are indeed `int`egers

- events can be _retrieved_ from the queue (e.g., `pygame.event.get([RELEVANT_TYPES])`)...
    * where `RELEVANT_TYPES` is a _list_ of event _types_ to be retrieved

- ... and possibly _provoked_ (i.e. appended to the queue) by the programmer (e.g., `pygame.event.post(event)`)
    * where `event` is an instance of `pygame.event.Event`

---

## Clean Code Recommendations

1. Better to explicitly represent _game objects_ in the code
    - __Game Object__ $\approx$ any entity that may appear in the game world (e.g. the circle)
        + interesting aspects: _size_, _position_ , _speed_, _name_, etc.
        + may have methods to _update_ its state
    - the _overall_ **game state** consists of _all_ game objects therein contained
        + $\Rightarrow$ update the game $\equiv$ update _each_ game objects
    - cf. [PyGame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

## Clean Code Recommendations

2. Better to explicitly represent _input handlers_ and _controllers_ in the code
    - __Input Handler__ $\approx$ any entity that may _interpret_ user inputs and map them to _game events_
        + supports plugging in different _key maps_
    - __Game Events__ $\approx$ represent _actions_ that make sense for game objects
        + e.g., `MOVE_UP`, `MOVE_DOWN`, `STOP`, etc.
        + custom event _types_ can be defined via [`pygame.event.custom_type()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.custom_type)
    - __Controller__ $\approx$ any entity that may _interpret_ game events and _update_ the game state accordingly

3. Better to delegate _rendering_ to a dedicated class taking care of the _view_ of the game
    - __View__ $\approx$ any entity that may _draw_ game objects on the screen

<br>

`Pong` game model comprehends:
1. `GameObject`: _visible_ entity in the game
    - relevant properties: `name`, `position`, `size`, \*`speed`\*, `bounding_box`
        * `position`, `size`, and \*`speed`\* are `Vector2` instances
    - particular cases: `Paddle`, `Ball`
        * `Paddle` instances are assigned to one `side` (_property_) of the screen
            + 4 possible _sides_ for as many `Direction`s: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
            + each paddle corresponds to a different _player_
                - to support _local_ **multiplayer**, different _key bindings_ are needed
2. `Board`: the plane upon which the game is played (black _rectangle_ in the figure)
    - relevant properties: `size`, `walls`
    - `Wall`: _invisible_ entity that _reflects_ the `Ball` when hit

3. Ancillary classes: `Vector2`, `Rectangle`, `Direction`
    - `Vector2` _utility_ class from PyGame, representing a _2D vector_
    - `Rectangle` _utility_ class, representing a _rectangle_, supporting __collision detection__
    - `Direction` is an _enumeration_ of 4 possible directions + `NONE` (lack of direction)

## Let's infer a model from the view (pt. 4)

Facilities of the `Pong` class, to __configure__ the game:
- `reset_ball(speed=None)`: _re-locates_ the `Ball` at the _center_ of the `Board`, setting its `speed` _vector_ to the given value
    + _random_ speed _direction_ is provided if `speed` is `None`
- `add_paddle(side, paddle=None)`: _assigns_ a `Paddle` to the `Pong`, at the given `side` (if not already present)
    + the `Paddle` is created from scratch if `paddle` is `None`
        * in this case, the paddle is _centered_ on the `side` of the `Board`
- `paddle(side)`: _retrieves_ the `Paddle` at the given `side`
- `has_paddle(side)`: _checks_ if a `Paddle` is present at the given `side`
- `remove_paddle(side)`: _removes_ the `Paddle` at the given `side`

Facilities of the `Pong` class, to __animate__ the game:
- `update(dt)`: _updates_ the game state, _moving_ the `Ball` and the `Paddles` according to the given time _delta_
    + computes _collisions_ between the `Ball` and the `Paddles` and the `Walls`
        * uses `_handle_collisions` method to the purpose
- `move_paddle(side, direction)`: _moves_ the selected `Paddle` in the given `direction` by setting its `speed` _vector_ accordingly
    + `paddle` can either be an `int` (index of the `Paddle` in the `paddles` list) or a `Direction` (side of the `Paddle`)
    + _left_ and _right_ paddles can only move _up_ and _down_, respectively
    + _up_ and _down_ paddles can only move _left_ and _right_, respectively
- `stop_paddle(side)`: _stops_ the selected `Paddle` from moving

---

## About collisions

- _Collision detection_ is a crucial aspect of game development
    + it is the process of _determining_ when two or more game objects _overlap_
    + it is the basis for _physics simulation_ in games

- In `Pong` collisions are very _simple_, as they simply rely on the game objects' __bounding boxes__
    + a _bounding box_ the __minimal__ _rectangle_ that _encloses_ the game object
    + a collision is detected when two bounding boxes _overlap_

- In `Pong` there are 3 sorts of relevant collisions:
    1. `Ball` vs. `Paddle`
    2. `Ball` vs. `Wall`
    3. `Paddle` vs. `Wall`

- __Bouncing__ can simply be achieved by _reversing_ the `Ball`'s speed _vector_ along the _colliding_ axis

## Bouncing

1. Suppose the `Ball` is close to an obstacle and `update()` is called

---

## Bouncing

2. When the position of the `Ball` is updated, it is now _overlapping_ an obstacle (wall, or paddle)

![](./bouncing-2.svg)

---

## Bouncing

3. `Bouncing` = _reversing_ the speed vector along the _colliding_ axis + re-locating the `Ball` outside the obstacle

![](./bouncing-3.svg)

---

## Bouncing

3. Another `update()` call will _move_ the `Ball` _away_ from the obstacle

## About Inputs

> __Insight__: _inputs_ are _external_ __data__, representing _events_ that may impact the system state
> <br> (most _commonly_ corresponding to users' _actions_)
> <br> (exceptions apply)

<br>

In a simple video game like Pong, we distinguish between:

- __control events__: corresponding to some _update_ in the _game state_
- __input events__: _low-level_ events which require some _processing_ to be translated into _control events_

---

## Input handling and Control Events (pt. 1)

### Design questions

1. What __input events__ are _relevant_ for the software, during its execution?
    - _keyboard_ inputs, in particular __pressures__ and __releases__ of _keys_
        + pressure should provoke a `Paddle`'s _movement_
        + release should provoke a `Paddle`'s _stop_

2. What other __control events__ are _relevant_ for the software, during its execution?
    - __player__ _joining_ or _leaving_ the game (mostly useful in _distributed_ setting)
    - __game__ _starting_ or _ending_ (mostly useful in _distributed_ setting)
    - __time__ _passing_ in the game
    - __paddle__ _moving_ or _stopping_

{{% fragment %}}

### Design choices

* We introduce two _abstractions_ to _handle_ inputs and control events:
    - `InputHandler` _interprets_ keyboard __input__ events and _generates_ __control events__
    - `EventHandler` _processes_ __control events__ and _updates_ the game _state_ (`Pong` class) accordingly

{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Input handling and Control Events (pt. 2)

### Important Remark

- Notice the __time passing__ event corresponds to _no user input_
- This _complicates_ the design
    * _conceptually_, it implies that the system __evolves__ even in absence of user inputs
    * _practically_, it implies that the system must be able to __generate__ control events _internally_
- At the _modelling_ level, this means one more _abstraction_ is needed
    + the __control loop__ is actually the abstraction that takes care of _time passing_ in the game

{{% fragment %}}

### More design choices

- To keep our design proposal _simple_, we:
    * consider the _time passing_ event as a _special_ kind of __input__...
    * ... not really provided by the user, but by the _control_ itself
    * so, the `InputHandler` is also in charge of _generating_ __time passing__ events

{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Input handling and Control Events (pt. 3)

### Important Remark

- In the general case, `Paddle`s are moved by players, via the _keyboard_
    + when players are __distributed__, the _keyboards_ are __different__
        * so __key bindings__ _can_ be the _same_ for all players (but still _customisable_)

    + when players are __local__, there's only __one__ keyboard
        * so __key bindings__ _must_ be _different_ for each player

{{% fragment %}}

### More design choices

* Useful additional _abstractions_:
    - `PlayerAction` _enumerates_ all possible _actions_ a player can perform (on a paddle)
        + e.g. __move__ _paddle_ in a given `Direction`, __stop__ _paddle_, __quit__ the game
    - `ActionMap`, associating _key codes_ to `PlayerAction`s

+ `ControlEvent`s are _custom_ PyGame events which _animate_ the game
    * each event instance is _parametric_ (i.e. may carry additional _data_)
        * e.g. `PADDLE_MOVE` carries the information about _which_ `Paddle` is moving and _where_ it is moving

## About outputs

> __Insight__: outputs are representations of the _system state_
> <br> that are _perceived_ by the _external world_
> <br> (most _commonly_ corresponding to _visual_ or _auditory_ _feedback_ for the user)

In our case:
- the output is just a __rendering__ of the game _state_ on the screen
- this is possible because we separated _model_, and _control_, so now it's time to separate the _view_
    * essentially, we're following the [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
    * where _model_ $\approx$ `Pong`, _control_ $\approx$ `EventHandler` + `InputHandler`
- if the rendering is updated _frequently enough_, the user _perceives_ the game as _animated_
    * the "frequently enough" is the _frame rate_ of the game (30-60 fps is common)

## Towards _Distributed_ Pong (pt. 1)

(only DS related aspects are discussed here)

1. __Use case collection__:
    - _where_ are the users?
        + sitting in front of they _own_ computer, connected to the _internet_ or _LAN_
        + we __want users to be able to play togther from _different_ locations__
    - _when_ and _how frequently_ do they interact with the system?
        + _sporadically_ they may start a game, but when that happens, _interactions_ among users are _very frequent_
    - _how_ do they _interact_ with the system? which _devices_ are they using?
        + pressing _keyboard_ keys on one _computer_ may impact what is _displayed_ on another
    - does the system need to _store_ user's __data__? _which_? _where_?
        + _no_ data needs to be stored, but a lot of information needs to be _exchanged_ among users during the game
            * this may change if _leaderboards_ are introduced
    - most likely, there will be _multiple_ __roles__
        + just _players_
        + possibly _spectators_, i.e. players providing _no input_ but getting the whole _visual feedback_

---

## Towards _Distributed_ Pong (pt. 1)

<br>

2. __Requirements analysis__:
    - how to synchronize and coordinate inputs coming from different players?
        + possibly, some _infrastructural component_ is needed, behind the scenes, to do this
    - will the system need to _scale_?
        + not really scale, but it must be able to support players _joining_ and _leaving_ the game at any time
    - how to handle _faults_? _how_ will it _recover_?
        + what if a player _goes offline_ during the game?
            1. e.g. the game _pauses_ until the player _reconnects_
            2. e.g. the ball position _resets_ to centre and the corresponding paddle is _removed_
            3. e.g. the corresponding _paddle_ is _frozen_ in place
        + what if the aforementioned infrastructural component becomes _unreachable_?
            1. e.g. the game _pauses_ until the component is _reachable_ again
    - _acceptance criteria_ will for all such additional requirements/constraints
        + _latency_ must be _low_ enough to allow for a _smooth_ game experience
            * e.g. avoid _lag_ in the ball/paddle movements

---

## Towards _Distributed_ Pong (pt. 1)

<br>

3. __Design__:
    - are there _infrastructural components_ that need to be introduced? _how many_?
    - how do components	_distribute_ over the network? _where_?

> In other words, _how is the infrastructure of the system organized?_

<!-- * e.g., one _server_ to coordinate _$N$ clients_ (one for each player) -->

<!-- * e.g. _centralised_ server on the cloud, _clients_ on all users' computers
* e.g. _centralised_ server on __one__ user's computer, _clients_ on __all__ other users' computers -->

## About the Distributed Pong _Infrastructure_ (pt. 1)

### No infrastructure (local)

Let's focus on information flow:

{{< image alt="No infrastructure for Pong" src="./local.svg" max-h="60vh" >}}

---

## About the Distributed Pong _Infrastructure_ (pt. 2)

### Centralized infrastructure

Let's suppose a central server is coordinating the game:

{{< image alt="Centralized infrastructure for Pong" src="./centralised.svg" max-h="60vh" >}}

---

## About the Distributed Pong _Infrastructure_ (pt. 3)

### Brokered infrastructure

Let's suppose a central server is coordinating the game, but a broker is used to _relay_ messages:

{{< image alt="Brokered infrastructure for Pong" src="./brokered.svg" max-h="60vh" >}}

---

## About the Distributed Pong _Infrastructure_ (pt. 4)

### Replicated infrastructure

Like the centralised one, but the server is replicated and a consensus protocol is used to keep replicas in sync:

{{< image alt="Replicated infrastructure for Pong" src="./replicated.svg" max-h="60vh" >}}

---

## About the Distributed Pong _Infrastructure_ (pt. 5)

### What to choose?

1. Local infrastructure implies no _distribution_ for players
2. Centralized infrastructure implies a _single point of failure_ (the server)
    + plus it _complicates deploy_:
        1. who's in charge of starting the server?
            * e.g., one player (makes the start-up procedure more complex)
            * e.g., hosted online (makes access control more critical, adds deploy and maintenance costs)
        2. where should the server be located?
3. Brokered infrastructure implies __two__ _single points of failure_ (the broker, the server)
    + essentially, it has all the _drawbacks_ of the centralized infrastructure, plus the _complexity_ of the broker
        1. where to deploy the broker?
        2. potentially _higher_ latency, due to the _additional_ hop for message propagation
    + may temporally _decouple_ the server from the clients, which is a __non-goal__ in our case
4. Replicated infrastructure is _overkill_ for a simple online game
    + for video games, it's better to _prioritize availability_ over consistency
    + no data storage $\implies$ no strong need for _consistency_

---

## Towards _Distributed_ Pong (pt. 2)

<br>

3. __Design__:
    - are there _infrastructural components_ that need to be introduced? _how many_?
        * e.g., one _server_ to coordinate _$N$ clients_ (one for each player)
    - how do components	_distribute_ over the network? _where_?
        * e.g., _centralised_ server on the cloud, _clients_ on all users' computers
        * e.g., _centralised_ server on __one__ user's computer, _clients_ on __all__ other users' computers
    - how do _domain entities_ __map to__ _infrastructural components_?
        * e.g., `PongGame` entity updated by _the server_ and replicated on _all clients_, in a _master-slave_ fashion
        * e.g., one `PongView` entity _per client_, to render the game state on the local screen
        * e.g., one `InputHandler` entity _per client_, to grasp local inputs and send them to the server
        * e.g., one `EventHandler` entity on the server, to receive remote inputs and update the `PongGame` entity accordingly
    - how do components _communicate_? _what_? _which_ __interaction patterns__ do they enact?
        * e.g., _request-response_? _publish-subscribe_?
    - do components need to store data? _what data_? _where_? _when_? _how many **copies**_?
        * e.g., no real need for data storage, but the overall state of the game must be _replicated_ on all clients ($N+1$ copies)
            + replication must be as _quick/frequent_ as possible to avoid _inconsistencies_
            + prioritize _availability_ over _consistency_
    - how do components _find_ each other?
        * e.g. clients are assumed to know the IP of the central server
    - _how_ do components _recognize_ each other?
        * e.g. mutual trust is assumed, no need for authentication

---

## Towards _Distributed_ Pong (pt. 3)

<br>

4. __Implementation__:
    - which __network protocols__ to use?
        * e.g. _UDP_: good for low-latency, real-time applications (let's go with this one!)
            + no big deal for _package loss_ in a video game, yet _duplication_, _unordered dispatch_, and _delays_ may give us headaches
        * e.g. _TCP_: good for _reliability_ but may introduce _latencies_
            + may complicate the design of the central server, which will have to manage several _simultaneous connections_
    - how should _in-transit data_ be __represented__?
        * e.g. any binary one would be better, to avoid latency bandwidth waste
            + we'll go with _JSON_, for didactic purposes, then switch to [BSON](https://bsonspec.org/)
    - __no need__ for _storage_ capabilities, so no need for a _database_
    - trust-based _communication_ $\implies$ no need for _authentication_
    - trust-based _authorization_ each client should only be able to command _one and only one paddle_
        * _first-come-first-served_ policy for paddle assignment

- __Coordinator__ is the central server, coordinating the game
    * it runs the _game loop_ and _updates_ the game state, _without_ listening to the keyboard, _nor_ rendering the game
    * it _receives_ inputs from the clients
    * it _periodically sends_ the updated game state to the clients

- __Terminal__ is the client's end point, visualising the game
    * it _listens_ to the keyboard and _sends_ inputs to the coordinator
    * it _receives_ the game state from the coordinator and _renders_ it on the screen

- __Event-Based Architecture__:
    * the coordinator _publishes_ the "game state update" events and _consumes_ "input" events
    * terminals _consume_ the "game state update" events and _publish_ "input" events

0. Assumptions
    - the coordinator is _started before_ any terminal
    - the coordinator is _reachable_ by all terminals

1. __Joining__:
    1. players _start_ terminals by _choosing_ their paddle (by side)
        + first-come-first-served policy
    2. terminals send a `PLAYER_JOIN` message to the coordinator upon _starting_
    3. the coordinator simply _registers_ the new paddle, and _resets_ the ball position
    4. the coordinator starts _accepting inputs_ from the new paddle/terminal
        + and _updates_ the game state accordingly

2. __Leaving__ (gracefully):
    1. players may press a _key_ (e.g. `ESC`) to _quit_ the game
    2. terminals send a `PLAYER_LEAVE` message to the coordinator upon _quitting_
        + only _after sending_ the message, the terminal node can _terminate_
    3. upon receiving the message, the coordinator _unregisters_ the paddle and _resets_ the ball position
    4. the coordinator _terminates_ if there are no more paddles
        + otherwise, it keeps operating as usual

## Joining/Leaving Protocol (issues)

1. what if the _coordinator_ is _not available_ when the terminal starts?

1. what if a _terminal_ crashes _before_ sending the `PLAYER_LEAVE` message?

1. how could the coordinator _distinguish_ between a _crashed_ terminal and one sending _no inputs_?

1. what if the _coordinator_ _crashes_ while some terminals are still running?

1. what if a _terminal_ selects a _side_ that is _already taken_?

1. what if a _terminal_ send inputs concerning the _wrong paddle_?

---

## Joining/Leaving Protocol (solutions)

1. what if the _coordinator_ is _not available_ when the terminal starts?
    - e.g., the _terminal_ simply terminates
    - e.g., the terminal _waits_ (up to a _timeout_, and no more than a _maximum_ amount of _retries_) for the coordinator to become available

1. what if a _terminal_ crashes _before_ sending the `PLAYER_LEAVE` message?
    - e.g., if UDP is used, some _custom_ __heart-beating__ mechanism may be needed
    - e.g., if TCP is used, the connection dies and the coordinator can notice the terminal's crash

1. how could the coordinator _distinguish_ between a _crashed_ terminal and one sending _no inputs_?
    - e.g. via _timeouts_ on the coordinator side

1. what if the _coordinator_ _crashes_ while some terminals are still running?
    - e.g. via _timeouts_ on the terminal side

1. what if a _terminal_ selects a _side_ that is _already taken_?
    - e.g. the coordinator _silently ignores_ the `PLAYER_JOIN` message
    - e.g. the coordinator _rejects_ the `PLAYER_JOIN` message and the terminal _terminates_
        + implies changing the __joining__ protocol to a _request-response_ one

1. what if a _terminal_ send inputs concerning the _wrong paddle_?
    - e.g. the coordinator _silently ignores_ the inputs
        + implies the coordinator is keeping track of _which paddle_ is associated with _which terminal_
    - e.g. the coordinator _kicks out_ the misbehaving terminal
        + same implication as above
        + implies changing the __leaving__ protocol in such a way it can be _initiated_ by the _coordinator_

### TODO

- Give a look to the code, especially the [`PongCoordinator`]({{<github-url repo="dpongpy" path="dpongpy/remote/centralised/__init__.py#L16">}}>) and [`PongTerminal`]({{<github-url repo="dpongpy" path="dpongpy/remote/centralised/__init__.py#L102">}}>) classes

- compare the code to the _design_ we discussed, especially the [interaction](#interaction-view) and [behavioural views](#behavioural-view)

### How to know?

1. what if the _coordinator_ is _not available_ when the terminal starts?
    - Start the _terminal_ when no _coordinator_ is running, what happens?

1. what if a _terminal_ crashes _before_ sending the `PLAYER_LEAVE` message?
    - Start the coordinator and then 2 terminals for 2 different paddles. Kill one terminal. What happens?

1. what if the _coordinator_ _crashes_ while some terminals are still running?
    - Start the coordinator and then 1 terminal. Kill the terminal. What happens?

1. what if a _terminal_ selects a _side_ that is _already taken_?
    - Start the coordinator and then 2 terminals for the same paddle. What happens?

1. what if a _terminal_ send inputs concerning the _wrong paddle_?
    - Inject a bug into the terminal to force sending events for the same paddle. Start the coordinator and then 2 terminals. What happens?
        ```python
        class Controller(PongInputHandler, EventHandler):           # dpongpy/remote/centralised/__init__.py, line 114
            def post_event(self, event: Event | ControlEvent, **kwargs):
                event = super().post_event(event, **kwargs)
                if ControlEvent.PADDLE_MOVE.matches(event):         # this is how you can inject the bug
                    event.dict["paddle_index"] = Direction.LEFT
                ...
        ```

## Distributed Pong Analysis (pt. 2)

> Are we prioritizing _availability_ or _consistency_ with the current design/implementation?

{{% fragment %}}

### How to know?

1. Let's try to simulate a _network partition_:
    - we're using UDP, so message drops are _possible_ already, when the coordinator and the host are on _different_ machines
    - to make it _network partitioning_ more evident, let's force a higher __package drop rate__
        + set the `UDP_DROP_RATE` _environment variable_ to a number __$p \in [0, 1]$__ (say, `0.2`) to affect the _probability_ of a package being dropped to _$p$_...
            * meaning that roughly the __$100p$%__ of the packages will be __dropped__ (`20%` in our case)
        + ... then _launch_ the coordinator and the terminal

2. is the gameplay __fluid__ or __laggy__?
    - fluid $\approx$ we're prioritizing _availability_
    - laggy $\approx$ we're prioritizing _consistency_

## Exercise: Available Distributed Pong

- __Goal__: modify the current `dpongpy` implementation to prioritize _availability_ over consistency, in order to make the game __fluid__, even in presence of _network issues_

- __Hints__: implement __speculative execution__ on the _terminal_-side, to make the game _appear available_ even when the coordinator non-responsive
    1. the terminal's game-loop should *never* __block__
        + in particular, it should _not block_ while waiting for the coodinator's __updates__
    2. rather, the terminal should continue updating the _local game state_ according to the _local inputs_, and render it as usual
    3. upon receiving a new update from the coordinator, the terminal should overwrite the _local game state_ with the _remote one_

- __Deadline__: December 31st, 2025

- __Incentive__: +1 point on the final grade (if solution is satisfying)

- __Submission__:
    1. fork the [`dpongpy` repository]({{< github-url repo="dpongpy" >}})
    2. create a new branch named `exercise-lab1`
    3. commit your changes to the new branch
    4. push the branch to your fork & create a __pull request__ to the original repository, entitled `[{{<academic_year>}} Surname, Name] Exercise: Available Distributed Pong`
        - in the pull request, describe your solution, motivate your choices, and explain how to test it
