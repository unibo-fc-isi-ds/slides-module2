# What is a Distributed System?

---

### [Leslie Lamport (1987)](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)

> A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable

### __Interpretation__

- hidden interdependencies between machines
- how a failure in one part of the system can have unforeseen consequences elsewhere

---

### ["Distributed Systems", Tannenbaum and Van Steen](http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS865/Lectures/Chap1/Chapter1a.htm) (the [book here](https://komputasi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mvsteen-distributed-systems-3rd-preliminary-version-3-01pre-2017-170215.pdf))

> A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system

### __Interpretation__

- illusion of a unified system...
- ... despite the fact that it is made up of multiple independent machines
- the key idea is that users should not be aware that the system is distributed.

---

### ["Distributed Systems — Concepts and Design", Coulouris et. al.](https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781447930174_A24570107/preview-9781447930174_A24570107.pdf)

> We define a distributed system as one in which hardware or software components
> located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by
> passing messages.

### __Interpretation__

- reliance on message passing across a network for communication

---

### ["Distributed Systems — Concepts and Design", Coulouris et. al.](https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781447930174_A24570107/preview-9781447930174_A24570107.pdf)

> We define a distributed system as one in which hardware or software components

### __Interpretation__

- reliance on message passing across a network for communication

---

### []"Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming", Van Roy and Haridi](https://webperso.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyHaridi2003-book.pdf)

> A distributed system is a set of computers that are linked together by a network

### __Interpretation__

- very abstract definition focusing on how distribution should be interpreted

## What is a Distributed System?

### Wrap up

These definitions cover the _essential characteristics_ of distributed systems:
- independent components,
- communication via messages, and the
- challenge of presenting a unified system to the user,
- despite failures or complexities within the system.

## Why would you make your system distributed?

Any or some of the following reasons:

- __Scalability__: Handling large-scale systems efficiently
- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: Ensuring reliability despite failures
- __Low Latency__ and __Geographical Distribution__: Providing better user experience across the globe
- __Resource Sharing__: Efficiently using computing power and storage
- __Handling Big Data__: Processing data locally rather than moving it
- __Parallelism__: Speeding up tasks through concurrent execution
- __Cost Efficiency__: Reducing infrastructure costs through resource pooling
- __Collaboration__: Enabling real-time updates and interactions across distances
- _The functionality to be provided_ by the system simply **implies** _distribution_

---

## Example: Google Search

- __Scalability__: Google handles billions of searches every day
- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: A single server cannot handle such a massive amount of data
- __Low Latency__ and __Geographical Distribution__: By distributing the search process across thousands of servers worldwide, Google can deliver search results quickly and reliably
- __Parallelism__: Processing multiple search queries concurrently

---

## Example: Social Networks (e.g., Instagram) or Messaging Apps (e.g., WhatsApp)

- __Scalability__: Millions of users are active at the same time
- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: A single server cannot handle such a massive amount of data
- __Low Latency__ : By distributing the service across multiple servers worldwide, the app can deliver messages quickly and reliably
- __Geographical Distribution__: Users can communicate across the globe
- __Handling Big Data__: Store users' data within that user's region (as per GDPR)
- __Parallelism__: Processing multiple messages concurrently
- __Collaboration__: Enabling real-time updates and interactions across distances
- The functionality is __inherently distributed__

---

## Example: Online Shopping (e.g., Amazon)

- __Scalability__: Millions of users are active at the same time
- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: A single server cannot handle such a massive amount of data
- __Low Latency__: By distributing the service across multiple servers worldwide, the app can deliver messages quickly and reliably
- __Geographical Distribution__: Comply to local regulations and regional preferences, e.g., language, currency, etc.
- __Parallelism__: Processing multiple orders concurrently
- _The functionality to be provided_ by the system simply **implies** _distribution_

---

## Example: Online Gaming (e.g., LoL, Fortnite)

- __Scalability__: Millions of users are active at the same time
- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: A single server cannot handle such a massive amount of data
- __Low Latency__: By distributing the service across multiple servers worldwide, the app can deliver messages quickly and reliably
- __Geographical Distribution__: Users can play with others across the globe
- __Parallelism__: Processing multiple games concurrently
- __Collaboration__: Enabling real-time updates and interactions across distances
- _The functionality to be provided_ by the system simply **implies** _distribution_

---

## Example: Google Docs (et. similia)

- __Scalability__: allows for different business models, e.g., subscription-based
- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: Allows for automatic, implicit updates / file saves / backups
- __Geographical Distribution__: Simplified sharing and collaboration across the globe
- __Parallelism__ and __Collaboration__: Multiple users can edit the same document concurrently

---

## Example: Federated Learning (e.g. [Google's Gboard](https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/12373137?hl=en))

- __Scalability__: Improve learning for all users (while keeping their data private)
- __Geo-Distribution__: Improve the functionality based on the data from different regions
- __Handling Big Data__: Process data locally rather than moving it
- __Parallelism__: Learning occurs on the user's device, anywhere, at any time
- __Cost Efficiency__: A single device would not be sufficient to process all the data
- __Resource Sharing__: Efficiently using computing power and storage, while preserving privacy

# How does the SE workflow change for distributed systems?

---

## Recap: Software Engineering Workflow

1. __Use case collection__: _negotiate_ expectations with customer(s) or stakeholders

1. __Requirements analysis__: produce a list of _requirements_ the final product should satisfy
    + with _acceptance criteria_ for each requirement

1. __Design__: produce a _blueprint_ of the software
    + __modelling__: what entities from the _real world_ are represented in the software?
        * how do they _behave_? how do they _interact_?

1. __Implementation__: write the _code_ that reifies the _design_ into software

1. __Verification__: verify that the software _meets_ the _requirements_
    + __automated__ _testing_: write more code to check whether the aforementioned implementation code works
    + __acceptance__ _testing_: test the system with _real_ data and _real_ users

1. __Release__: make one particular _version_ of the software _available_ to the _customers_

1. __Deployment__: install and activate the software for the software

1. __Documentation__: produce _manuals_ and _guides_ for the software

1. __Maintenance__: fix _bugs_, _improve_ the software, _adapt_ it to _new_ requirements

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

(only additional steps are listed)

1. __Use case collection__:
    - _where_ are the users?
    - _when_ and _how frequently_ do they interact with the system?
    - _how_ do they _interact_ with the system? which _devices_ are they using?
    - does the system need to _store_ user's __data__? _which_? _where_?
    - most likely, there will be _multiple_ __roles__

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

2. __Requirements analysis__:
    - most likely, answers to the questions above imply __technical constrains__ on the system
        * e.g. where to store data?
            + in case of multiple data centers, how to keep them consistent?
    - will the system need to _scale_? how to handle _faults_? _how_ to _recover_ from failures?
    - _acceptance criteria_ will for all such additional requirements/constraints

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

3. __Design__:
    - are there _infrastructural components_ that need to be introduced? _how many_?
        * e.g. _clients_, _servers_, _load balancers_, _caches_, _databases_, _message brokers_, _queues_, _workers_, _proxies_, _firewalls_, _CDNs_, _etc._
    - how do components	_distribute_ over the network? _where_?
        * e.g. what are the IP addresses of the servers / brokers / databases / etc.?
    - how do _domain entities_ __map to__ _infrastructural components_?
        * e.g. state of a video game on central server, while inputs/representations on clients
        * e.g. where to store messages in an IM app? for how long?
    - how do components _communicate_? _what_? _which_ __interaction patterns__ do they enact?
    - do components need to store data? _what data_? _where_? _when_? _how many **copies**_?
        * in case of network partition, should the system be _available_ or _consistent_?
    - how do components _find_ each other?
        * how to _name_ components?
        * e.g. _service discovery_, _load balancing_, _etc._
    - _how_ do components _recognize_ each other?
        * e.g. _authentication_, _authorization_, _etc._
    - what should happen when a component _fails_? is it _really_ a failure?
        * e.g. _retries_, _back-off_, _graceful degradation_, _etc._

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

4. __Implementation__:
    - which __network protocols__ to use?
        * e.g. UDP, TCP, HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, XMPP, AMQP, MQTT, etc.
    - how should _in-transit data_ be __represented__?
        * e.g. JSON, XML, YAML, Protocol Buffers, etc.
    - how should _persistent data_ be __stored__?
        * e.g. relations, documents, key-value, graph, etc.
    - how should _databases_ be __queried__?
        * e.g. SQL, NoSQL, etc.
    - how should components be _authenticated_?
        * e.g. OAuth, JWT, etc.
    - how should components be _authorized_?
        * e.g. RBAC, ABAC, etc.

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

5. __Verification__:
    - how to **_unit_-test** distributed components?
    - testing the _integration_ among components is _paramount_
    - how to **_end-to-end_-test** the system?
        * e.g. production vs. test environment
    - _deployment_ __automation__ is commonly used to _test_ the system in _production-like_ environment

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

6. __Release__:
    - components may (and should) have their __own__ _release cycles_ and _versions_
    - components should be _resilient_ to the __coexistence__ of _multiple_ versions
    - _rolling_ __updates__ are _preferred_ over _big bang_ updates

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

7. __Deployment__:
    - _where_ to deploy components?
        * e.g. _cloud_, _on-premises_, _hybrid_?
    - _how_ to deploy components?
        * e.g. _containers_, _VMs_, _bare metal_?
    - _how_ to _scale_ components?
        * e.g. _horizontally_, _vertically_, _auto-scaling_?
    - _how_ to _monitor_ components?
        * e.g. _logs_, _metrics_, _traces_?
    - _how_ to _secure_ components?
        * e.g. _firewalls_, _encryption_, _certificates_, _etc._
    - all such aspects should be _automated_
        * tools and companies exist just for this!

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

8. __Documentation__:
    - protocols and data formats should be _well-documented_
        * allowing for third-parties to create _compatible_ components
    - e.g. _Web API_ specification is public for most Web services

---

## Software Engineering Workflow for _Distributed Systems_

9. __Maintenance__:
    - continuous __monitoring__ of _performance_ and _availability_
        * tools and companies exist just for this!
    - _issues tracking_ is non-trivial (may require ad-hoc sub-systems)
    - _sunsetting_ old versions is _crucial_ $\rightarrow$ _coexistence_ of multiple versions
        * __End-of-Life__ should be _scheduled_, not _abrupt_

# Nomenclature

---

## Infrastructure

> The set of hardware, software, and networking facilities that allow the many pieces of a distributed system to communicate and inter-operate over a network

$\approx$ the set of _infrastructural components_ composing the _backbone_ of the distributed system

- Distributed systems may rely on similar infrastructures, regardless of the different functionalities they provide
- The infrastructure is __transparent__ to the _end-users_, yet essential for the _system_ to work

{{% fragment %}}

#### <br> Example

Consider your fancy social network of choice (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc.)
+ it looks like a dashboard on you phone / computer, but...
    + ... where are the _data_ stored?
    + ... where are the _messages_ after they have been sent but before they reach your phone?
    + ... where does information _processing_ happen?
+ different sorts of computations are performed on different _infrastructural components_, depending on their _role_ in the system

{{% /fragment %}}

---

{{%section%}}

## Infrastructural Components

> An infrastructural component consists of a software unit — most commonly a process — playing a precise role in the distributed system.
> The role depends on the purpose of the component in the system, and/or how it interacts.

### Examples

clients, servers, brokers, load balancers, caches, databases, queues, masters, workers, proxies, etc.

---

## Synonyms

- __Node__ $\equiv$ an infrastructural component for which the _role_ is __not__ relevant

- __Peer__ $\equiv$ an infrastructural component for which the _role_ is __not__ specified
    * because all components play the same role(s)

---

## Clients and servers

![Clients and server concept](./client-server.png)

- __Server__ $\equiv$ a component with a _well-known name_/address _responding_ to _requests_ coming from clients
    * it's the components that _listens_ (waits) for remote requests
    * commonly it exposes an _interface_ ($\approx$ the requests it can answer to) to _clients_

- __Client__ $\equiv$ a component that sends _requests_ to servers, waiting for _responses_
    * it's the components that _initiates_ the interaction
    * it may expose an _interface_ to _users_ on how to _interact_ with the server

---

## Proxy

{{< image src="./proxy.png" height="50vh" >}}

<br>

- __Proxy__ $\equiv$ a server acting as a _gateway_ towards another server
    * it _intercepts_ requests from clients and forwards them to the actual server
    * it _intercepts_ responses from the actual server and forwards them to the client
    * it may _cache_ responses to _reduce_ the _load_ on the server

- A _proxy_ performing _caching_ is called a _cache server_ (or just _cache_)

---

## Load Balancer

{{< image src="./load-balancer.png" height="60vh" alt="Load Balancer concept" >}}

- __Load Balancer__ $\equiv$ a proxy _distributing_ incoming requests among multiple servers
    * according to some _distribution policy_:
        + _round-robin_,
        + _least connections_,
        + _least response time_,
        + etc.

---

## Broker

![Broker concept](./broker.png)

- __Broker__ $\equiv$ a server _mediating_ the _communication_ between _producers_ and _consumers_ of data (a.k.a. messages)
    * it _receives_ messages from producers and _forwards_ them to (1 or more) consumers
    * common assumption: consumers _declare_ their interest in receiving messages

- __Producer__ $\equiv$ the component _sending_ messages to _producer(s)_ (via the broker)

- __Consumer__ $\equiv$ the component _receiving_ messages from _consumer(s)_ (via the broker)

- The same component can be simultaneously a _producer_ and a _consumer_

---

## \[Broker with\] Queues

![Queue concept](./queue.jpg)

- __Queue__ $\approx$ a data structure where messages are _stored_ in a _FIFO_ manner
    * FIFO storage $\rightarrow$ messages are consumed in the order they were produced
    * storage $\rightarrow$ messages are _not_ lost if consumers are _unavailable_

---

## Message oriented middleware (MOM)

![MOM concept](./mom.png)

- __MOM__ $\approx$ a sort of broker having multiple channels for messages
    * messages involving the same _topic_ are sent to the same _channel_
    * consumers subscribe to _channels_

- __Topic__ $\equiv$ a _label_ for messages, allowing
    * producers to control which _consumers_ receive the message
    * consumers to _filter_ messages they are interested in
    * the broker to _route_ messages to the correct consumers

- Yes, most MOM technologies use queues to implement channels

---

## Database

![Database concept](./three-tier.webp)

- __Database__ $\equiv$ a server specialized in _storing_ and _retrieving_ data
    * in three-tier architectures, the database is the _third_ tier
        + acting as a server for the server (which acts as a client w.r.t the database)

---

## Master—Worker (a.k.a. Master—Slave, or Leader—Follower)

![Master—Worker concept](./master-worker.png)

- __Master__ $\equiv$ a server _coordinating_ the _work_ of multiple workers
    * it _distributes_ the work among workers
    * it _collects_ the results from workers

- __Worker__ $\equiv$ a server _executing_ the _work_ assigned by the master

- Common use cases:
    - \[master—worker\] _parallel_ computation
    - \[master—slave\] _replication_ of data

{{%/section%}}

{{%section%}}

## Interaction Patterns

> An __interaction pattern__ describes how different _components_ (nodes, processes, etc.) _communicate_ and _coordinate_ their actions to achieve a common goal.
> These patterns define the _flow of messages_, _responsibilities_ of __participants__, and the _timing_ and _sequencing_ of __communications__.

e.g. _request-response_, _publish-subscribe_, _auction_, _etc.

### Key points

- __Participants__: we assume that there are _$N \geq 2$_ participants
- __Roles__: participants play _well-defined_ roles, most commonly:
    * __initiator__: the participant _initiating_ the interaction
    * __responder__: the participant _waiting_ for _some other participant_ to initiate the interaction
- __Messages__: information _exchanged_ among participants, most commonly containing at least:
    * __payload__: the actual content of the message
    * __metadata__: information _about_ the message, e.g. _source_, _destination_, _timestamp_, _conversation id_, etc.

---

## How to represent Interaction Patterns?

1. __Sequence diagrams__: _visual_ representation of the _flow_ of messages between participants
    * _time_ is _vertical_, _participants_ are _horizontal_
    * _arrows_ represent _messages_ sent from one participant to another
    * _lifelines_ represent the _lifetime_ of a participant

![Example of a Sequence Diagram](./diagram-sequence.png)

### Hints

- see explanation at <https://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams.html>
- use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) to _automatically_ generate sequence diagrams from textual descriptions
    + many Web-based picture generators, e.g. [http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SoWkIImgAStDuNBAJrBGjLDmpCbCJbMmKiX8pSd9vt98pKi1IW80)

---

## How to represent Interaction Patterns?

2. __Message flow graphs__: _visual_ representation of the _flow_ of messages
    * each _node_ represents a __type__ of _message_ (e.g. _request_, _response_, _notification_, etc.)
    * each _directed edge_ represents an admissible _reply_ to a _message_
    * the graph may contain _cycles_, if the pattern allows for _repeated_ interactions, or _resets_
    * nodes may be represented in different colours/shapes depending on which _role_ sends/receives the message

{{< image src="./user-agent-protocol.svg" width="65vw" link="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-40878-6_3" >}}

### Hints

- in _OO programming languages_, each message type can be represented as a _class_
- you may use class diagrams (e.g. in [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram)) to represent them
- you may also depict the graph otherwise, via graph-drawing tools (e.g. [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) or [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed))

---

## How to represent Interaction Patterns?

3. __State diagrams (a.k.a. state machines)__: _visual_ representation of the _internal state transitions_ of a participant
    * each _state_ represents a _condition_ of the participant (e.g. before/after a message is sent/received)
    * each _transition_ represents an _event_ that _changes_ the _state_ of the participant
        + most commonly, a message _reception_ or _sending_
    * _initial_ and _final_ states are _special_ states representing the _start_ and _end_ of the interaction
    * most commonly, there's _one state diagram per participant_

### Hints

- use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/state-diagram) to _automatically_ generate state diagrams from textual descriptions

---

## Which representation to use?

- The three representations are _complementary_
- So you should use them _together_ to _fully_ describe an interaction pattern

<br>

{{% col %}}
- 2 roles: __client__ and __server__
- 2 sorts of messages: __request__ and __response__
- __each__ _request_ is _followed_ by __one__ _response_
- _client_ is the __initiator__, _server_ is the __responder__
- _client_ __sends__ the _request_, _server_ __sends__ the _response_
- _client_ __waits__ for the _response_, _server_ __waits__ for the _request_
- often used to realise:
    + _remote procedure calls_ (RPC)
    + _remote method invocations_ (RMI)
    + (web) _services_

- 2 roles: __publisher__ and __subscriber__
- 2 sorts of messages: __subscribe__ and __notify__
- 2 _phases_ of interaction: __subscription__ and __notification__
    1. __Subscription__ phase: _subscribers_ __declare__ their _interest_ in _receiving_ message
        * subscribers are _initiators_ here
    2. __Notification__ phase: _publishers_ __send__ messages to _subscribers_
        * messages are _broadcasted_ or _multicasted_ depending on the implementation
- messages of type _notify_ carry __messages__, commonly representing events
- messages of type _subscribe_ may carry __topics__, commonly representing the topic of interest (for the subscriber)
- notice that subscription is, essentially, a _request-response_ pattern

### Publish—Subscribe with Broker

Notice that the publisher here is acting as a __broker__
* one may re-design the pattern with _explicit_ broker
* this is commonly useful to _decouple_ the _publisher_ from the _subscribers_
* most commonly, brokers _store_ messages until they are _consumed_

### Unicast vs. Broadcast vs. Multicast

{{< image src="./cast.png" width="60vw" alt="Depiction of the three types of communication" >}}

<br/>

- __Unicast__: _one-to-one_ communication
- __Broadcast__: _one-to-all_ communication
- __Multicast__: _one-to-many_ communication
    * implies a _selection criterion_ for the _many_

- 4 _phases_ of interaction:
    1. __Call for Proposals__: _initiator_ broad- or multi-casts a _request_ a CFP
        + commonly defining a _deadline_ + _task request_
    2. __Proposal Submission__: _contractors_ __submit__ proposals to _initiator_
        + commonly containing _estimated cost_
    3. __Proposal Evaluation__: _initiator_ __evaluates__ proposals and __chooses__ the best one
    4. __Award Contract__: _initiator_ __awards__ the contract to the chosen contractor
        + the chosen contractor __accepts__ the contract
    5. __Contract Execution__: _contractor_ __executes__ the contract and __returns__ the result

- not shown in the picture:
    1. lack of proposals (i.e. no contractor)
    2. no proposal chosen
    3. _contractor_ may _reject_ the contract

## Common Interaction Protocols (pt. 4)

### Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)

- FIPA is a _standardization_ body for _agent-based_ systems
- **Very** rough analogy: _agent_ $\approx$ distributed _component_ in a distributed system
- FIPA has _standardized_ many _interaction protocols_ for agents
    * e.g. _contract net_, _request-response_, _subscription_, _auction_, _etc.

# Architecture and Architectural Styles

(recall theory from Module 1's {{< module1-m6 >}})

---

## Recap: Software Architecture vs. Architectural Style

- Roy Fielding (2000):
> A __software architecture__ is an abstraction of the run-time elements of a software system during some phase of its operation.
> [...]
> It is defined by a _configuration_ of __architectural elements__ constrained in their relationships in order to achieve a desired set of _architectural properties_.


- Very roughly:
> __Architectural style__ $\approx$ _patterns_ of architectures which are known to work in practice

### Main architectural styles for distributed systems

* _layered_ architectures
* _object-based_ architectures
* _event-based_ architectures
* _shared data-space_ architectures

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 1)

### Layered Architecture (concept)

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
{{< image src="./architecture-layered.png" alt="Layered Architecture" >}}
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
+ Which __infrastructural components__?
    - Each layer is a __server__ (or a _proxy_) for the layer(s) _above_ it
    - Each layer is a __client__ for the layer(s) _below_ it

+ Which __interaction patterns__?
    - _Request—Response_: (a.k.a. remote procedure call, RPC)
        * _upper_ layers issue __requests__ to _lower_ layers
        * _lower_ layers issue __responses__ to _upper_ layers
    - sometimes, _Publish—Subscribe_:
        * _upper_ layers _subscribe_ to _lower_ layers
        * _lower_ layers _notify_ _upper_ layers

+ Constraints:
    - _no cycles_ among layers
        * i.e. _lower_ layers_ should not contact _upper_ layers

+ Example: (Web Services)
    - [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net) (looks for flights / hotels)
        * relying on the Web services of airlines / hotels
        * relying on the [Booking](https://www.booking.com) portal
            + all of which have their own _layered_ architecture

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 1)

### Layered Architecture (particular cases)

#### Three-Tier Architecture

{{< image src="./three-tier.webp" alt="Classic three-tier application architecture" >}}

- __Presentation Tier__: responsible for _presenting_ information to the _user_, and _accepting_ user _input_
- __Application Tier__: responsible for _processing_ user _requests_, and _executing_ business _logic_, __updating system state__
- __Data Tier__: responsible for _storing_ and _retrieving_ data, and _managing_ data _access_, __persisting system state__

cf. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)>

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 1)

### Layered Architecture (analysis)

#### Pros

1. **Separation of Concerns**: each layer handles a specific responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Modularity**: layers are independent, allowing easier updates, testing, and replacement without affecting the entire system.

3. **Reusability**: common functionality in layers can be reused across different systems or projects.

4. **Scalability**: the system can scale by modifying or optimizing individual layers (e.g., scaling the database or network layer independently).

5. **Maintainability**: bugs or issues can be isolated to specific layers, making troubleshooting simpler.

6. **Abstraction**: layers provide clear abstractions, allowing higher layers to interact with the system without needing to know the internal details of lower layers.

7. **Interoperability**: a well-defined interface between layers promotes compatibility and enables the use of different technologies in each layer.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 1)

### Layered Architecture (analysis)

#### Cons

1. **Performance Overhead**: multiple layers can introduce latency, especially if there are excessive data transformations or processing between layers.

2. **Complexity in Design**: designing and managing multiple layers can increase overall system complexity, particularly in very large systems.

3. **Rigid Structure**: strict layer separation can limit flexibility, making it harder to implement cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) efficiently.

4. **Duplication of Functionality**: if layers are not carefully defined, functionality can be duplicated across layers, leading to inefficiencies.

5. **Potential for Over-Engineering**: in smaller or simpler systems, using a layered architecture might introduce unnecessary complexity when simpler architectures would suffice.

6. **Difficulty in Layer Communication**: strict adherence to layer boundaries might make certain interactions cumbersome, requiring unnecessary intermediate steps.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 1)

### Layered Architecture (analysis)

#### Personal Opinion of the Teacher

- _Layered_ architectures are _simple_ and _easy_ to _understand_
- It works well in most cases, you can consider it the _default_ choice
- Prefer:
    1. _two-tier_ (3-tier with no real DBMS) architectures for _quick and dirty_ systems
    2. _three-tier_ architectures for if _flexibility_ is not a primary concern
    3. _hexagonal_ architectures for systems that may need to _scale_ in _complexity_

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 2)

### Object-Based Architecture (concept)

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
{{< image src="./architecture-objectbased.png" alt="Object-Based Architecture" >}}
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
+ Which __infrastructural components__?
    - each is object simultaneously a __client__ and a __server__ for other objects

+ Which __interaction patterns__?
    - _Request—Response_: (a.k.a. remote method invocation, RMI)
        * _objects_ issue __requests__ to _other objects_
        * _other objects_ __respond__

+ Constraints:
    - basically none

+ Examples:
    - [Microsoft Component Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) COM
    - [Java RMI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/hello/hello-world.html)
    - [Common Object Request Broker Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture) (CORBA)

{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 2)

### Object-Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Pros

1. **Encapsulation**: objects encapsulate data and behaviour, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.

2. **Reusability**: objects can be reused across different parts of the system or in different applications, reducing duplication of code.

3. **Modularity**: components are independent and self-contained, allowing easier upgrades, testing, and maintenance.

4. **Clear Interface Definition**: objects interact through well-defined interfaces, making it easier to manage dependencies and interactions between components.

5. **Flexibility**: objects can be distributed across different nodes, enabling flexibility in deployment and scalability in a distributed system.

6. **Language Agnosticism** (e.g., CORBA): some object-based systems (like CORBA) support multi-language environments, allowing developers to use the best language for each component while maintaining system integration.

7. **Dynamic Behaviour**: objects can be created, modified, or destroyed dynamically, allowing more flexible and adaptive systems.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 2)

### Object-Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Cons

1. **Performance Overhead**: the communication between distributed objects, especially over a network, can introduce significant latency and performance overhead.

2. **Complexity in Management**: managing the lifecycle and communication of distributed objects can add complexity, particularly in handling object references, synchronization, and failure recovery.

3. **Difficulty in Debugging**: debugging distributed objects is more complex due to the separation between client and server objects, especially when communication spans across different networks or systems.

4. **Scalability Limitations**: while object-based systems are modular, they may not scale efficiently in very large systems due to the overhead of managing object communication and state.

5. **Security Concerns**: distributed objects expose interfaces that can be exploited if not secured properly, making security management more challenging.

6. **Tight Coupling through Interfaces**: objects often rely on specific interfaces, which can lead to tight coupling between components, reducing flexibility in modifying or replacing objects.

7. **State Management**: maintaining the state of distributed objects can be complex, especially in cases of network failures or when objects need to be synchronized across multiple nodes.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 2)

### Object-Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Personal Opinion of the Teacher

- _Object-based_ architectures were a thing in the 90s and early 2000s
- They never really took off, and are now mostly _legacy_
- OOP is good for developing individual _components_, where objects share the same _address space_
- Inter-object _interactions_ are so _fine-grained_ and _intertwined_ in OOP that adding network in between makes it __unmanageable__
- Just __don't__ use this when designing a new system

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 3)

### Event Based Architecture (concept)

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
{{< image src="./architecture-eventbased.png" alt="Event-Based Architecture" >}}
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
+ Which __infrastructural components__?
    - __event bus__ $\approx$ a _broker_ for _events_ OR a set of _brokers_ with a _routing_ mechanism
    - __servers__ are _producers_ and _consumers_ of _events_
    - __clients__ commonly just interact with servers, as in _layered_ architectures

+ Which __interaction patterns__?
    - _Request—Response_: client $\leftrightarrow$ server
    - _Publish-Subscribe_: server $\leftrightarrow$ event bus

+ Constraints:
    - servers do _not_ really _know_ each other...
    - ... they just know which __event__ _to react_ to or _to produce_

+ Remarks:
    - much used in the _industry_ to create __modular__ systems
        + where _modules_ are realised in different moments/technologies

{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 3)

### Event Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Pros

1. **Scalability**: event-driven systems can scale more easily as components are decoupled and can handle many events concurrently.

2. **Real-time Processing**: events are processed as they happen, enabling real-time responses and immediate actions.

3. **Loose Coupling**: components are loosely coupled, improving flexibility and allowing independent service updates without affecting the whole system.

4. **Resilience**: fault tolerance is improved, as event producers and consumers are decoupled, reducing the risk of single points of failure.

5. **Asynchronous Communication**: systems can handle tasks asynchronously, improving responsiveness and system performance.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 3)

### Event Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Cons

1. **Complexity**: event-driven systems can be more complex to design, implement, and maintain, particularly with large-scale event flows.

2. **Debugging Challenges**: tracking the flow of events and identifying issues can be difficult, especially in distributed systems with asynchronous operations.

3. **Event Ordering**: ensuring the correct order of event processing can be challenging, especially in distributed systems with multiple consumers.

4. **Latency**: while events are often processed in real-time, network latency or communication issues can delay event delivery or processing.

5. **Data Consistency**: ensuring consistency across different services or systems can be harder in event-driven systems due to asynchronous processing.

6. **Single point of failure**: if the event hub is not properly managed (e.g., no fault-tolerant mechanisms), system may become faulty or unavailable.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 3)

### Event Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Personal Opinion of the Teacher

- **Event-based** architectures are _very_ _popular_ in the _industry_
- They are also pretty complex to _design_ and _implement_: not at all entry level
- Future courses in _this master programme_ will cover this in _more detail_
- Understanding of how _layered_ architectures work is a good _starting point_ for _event-based_ architectures
    + also because the two styles are often combined

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 4)

### Shared Dataspace Architecture (concept)

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
{{< image src="./architecture-shareddataspace.png" width="40vw" alt="Shared Dataspace Architecture" >}}
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
+ Which __infrastructural components__?
    - _clients_ and _databases_

+ Which __interaction patterns__?
    - _Request—Response_: client _reads/writes_ __data__ from/to database
    - _Publish-Subscribe_:
        * support for asynchronous _notifications_ of _data_ changes
        * support for _streaming_ big query results

+ Constraints:
    - clients only perform _CRUD_ operations on the database

+ Examples:
    - Oracle's [JavaSpaces](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/javaspaces.html)
    - IBM's [TSpaces](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5387119)
    - GigaSpaces's [XAP](https://xap.github.io/)
{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 4)

### Shared Dataspace Architecture (analysis)

#### Pros

1. **Decoupled Communication**: clients do not need to interact directly, allowing for more flexible and asynchronous communication.

2. **Simplified Coordination**: by using a shared space, different processes can coordinate without knowing about each other, simplifying synchronization in distributed systems.

3. **Scalability**: components can be added or removed from the system without affecting others, making the architecture inherently scalable.

4. **Fault Tolerance**: since communication happens through a shared space, if one component fails, others can still operate, improving resilience.

5. **Loose Coupling**: different parts of the system are loosely coupled through the shared data space, enabling more flexibility in how the system components interact.

6. **Asynchronous Processing**: processes can post data to the space and move on without waiting for others to consume it, improving system responsiveness and throughput.0

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 4)

### Shared Dataspace Architecture (analysis)

#### Cons

1. **Performance Overhead**: accessing a shared space, particularly in a distributed environment, can introduce latency and performance bottlenecks.

2. **Data Consistency Challenges**: ensuring consistency between the data posted in the shared space and its consumers can be difficult, especially with concurrent access.

3. **Concurrency Issues**: managing multiple processes accessing or modifying the same shared data can lead to race conditions and other concurrency issues.

4. **Limited Visibility**: because of the decoupled nature of the system, it can be harder to track or debug the flow of data and interactions between components.

5. **Complexity in Data Management**: house-keeping the shared data space (e.g., cleaning up outdated data, managing space, etc.) adds additional complexity to the system.

6. **Single point of failure**: if the shared space is not properly managed (e.g., no fault-tolerant mechanisms), data may be lost if the space fails or system may become completely unavailable.

---

## Architectural Styles in Practice (pt. 4)

### Event Based Architecture (analysis)

#### Personal Opinion of the Teacher

- **Shared dataspace** architectures only make sense in few _niches_
- e.g. in _distributed_ __data processing__, where computational burdens are _shared_ among _many_ nodes
- e.g. when the distributed systems' _state_ is _shared_ among most/all nodes, and _concurrent updates_ are necessary
    + such as in _distributed databases_ or _distributed file systems_, or in _non-real-time_ __multiplayer__ video games

## Features Impacting DS Design

These features impact the infrastructure, interaction patterns, or architecture of DS:

1. __Redundancy__: data, services, or hardware are replicated across multiple nodes or servers to ensure availability in case of failure.

2. __Failover__: when a primary node or service fails, a backup (secondary node) takes over.

3. __Checkpoints__ and __Rollback Recovery__: periodically saving the state of a process so that in case of failure, the system can roll back to the last known good state.

4. __Consensus__: achieving agreement between distributed nodes, ensuring consistent decision-making, even in case of failures.

5. __Hearth-beats__: periodic signals sent between nodes to ensure they are alive and responsive.

6. __Timeouts__ and __Retries__: setting timeouts for operations and retrying them in case of failure or unresponsiveness.

7. __Authorization__ and __Authentication__: ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access data or services.

8. __Data Partitioning__: splitting data across multiple nodes to improve performance and scalability, or respect administrative constraints.

---

## About Redundancy

### What

- __Data__: making _copies_ of the data across multiple nodes
- __Services__: deploying _multiple instances_ of the same service across different nodes
- __Hardware__: using multiple computers, _storage devices_, or network components

### Why

- __Fault Tolerance__: ensures that the system remains operational even if some components fail
    + also avoiding _data loss_
- __Availability__: distributing the load across multiple nodes, reducing the load on each node
- __Scalability__: easier to _scale_ the system up/down when the load increases/decreases

### How

- __Replication__: copying data or services across multiple nodes
- \[Data\] __Sharding__ : splitting data into smaller parts and distributing them across multiple nodes
    * when _all_ nodes have _all_ data, it's called _replication_...
    * ... when _each_ node has _only_ a _part_ of the data, it's called _sharding_

### Implications

- _Data_ replication $\Rightarrow$ _consistency_ issues $\Rightarrow$ _consensus_ algorithms OR _master—slave_ replication
- _Service_ replication $\Rightarrow$ _load balancing_ issues $\Rightarrow$ more complex infrastructure
- _Service_ replication $\Rightarrow$ _state management_ issues $\Rightarrow$ _state-less_ server + _stateful_ database

---

## About Failover

### What

- __Active-passive__ failover: the backup node become active when the primary fails

- __Active-active__ failover: all replicas are active, and traffic is rerouted in case of failure

### Why

- __Fault Tolerance__ and __Availability__: ensures that the system remains operational even the component fail

### How

- __Load-balancer__ or __proxy__ to reroute traffic to the backup node(s)

### Implications

- Same as in _service replication_
- Need for a mechanism to _detect_ failures, e.g. __hear-beats__ (see next slides)

---

## About Checkpoints and Rollback Recovery

### What

- __Checkpoints__: saving the state of a process at regular intervals
    * this is similar to _backups_, but it's most commonly _automatic_
- __Rollback Recovery__: in case of failure, the system can roll back to the last known good state
    * again, stress on the _automatic_ part

### Why

- __Fault Tolerance__: it may be hard to prevent some _bad situation_ from happening,
so this is a way to _recover_ from it when it does

### How

1. by designing your system to be able _snapshot_ its state & _restore_ snapshots upon failures __automatically__
2. by designing your system to track _variations_ (rather than _states_) and compute the _states_ from the _variations_
    - e.g. [Command Query Responsibility Segregation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) (CQRS)

### Implications

- Requires ad-hoc _modelling_, _architectural_, and _infrastructural_ __decisions__

---

## About Consensus

### What

- A __protocol__ to ensure that some nodes (most commonly _servers_ or _databases_) in a DS agree on a common decision
    * decision could be _"which operation to perform on data"_ or _"who to elect as a leader"_, etc
    * even in case of _failures_
        + e.g. __crashes__: one node stops responding
        + e.g. __byzantine failures__: one node sends wrong information (either by mistake or deliberately)

### Why

- __Consistency__: ensures that nodes in the system have the same view of the data
- __Fault Tolerance__: ensures that the system can continue to operate even if some nodes fail
- __Data Redundancy__: see previous slides

### How

- _Byzantine Fault Tolerant_ (BFT) protocols, e.g. [PBFT](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/osdi99/full_papers/castro/castro.ps)
- _Crash Fault Tolerant_ protocols,  e.g. [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)), [Raft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science))

### Implications

- __Complexity__: design is more complex, e.g. clients may need to know _which_ replica(s) to contact
- __Latency__: in the eyes of _clients_, due to consensus going on _between_ request and response

---

## About Heart-beats, Timeout, Retries

### What

- __Heart-beats__ are _periodic_ signals sent between nodes to ensure they are _alive_ and _responsive_
    * if a node stops sending heart-beats within _the period_, it's considered _dead_
    * signal $\approx$ (almost) empty message: only its reception matter
- __Timeout__: amount of _time_ necessary to _locally_ mark a _remote operation_ as _failed_ (e.g. node as unreachable)
- __Retry__: commonly a single failure not enough (e.g. short timeout, bad luck) so better to _retry a few times_
    <!-- * commonly implies to parameters:  -->
    * __max retries__: maximum amount of retries before considering an actual failure
    * __delay__: amount of time to wait before retrying again (may be variable, cf. [exponential back-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff))

### Why

- __Fault Tolerance__: basic mechanism to _detect_ failures, to be able to _react_ to them ASAP

### How

1. Nodes keep a connection open between them, and send data periodically
    + alternatively, they send each other messages with no connection
    + some application may have this feature _built-in_, others may need ad-hoc design
2. _Timeout_ + _retrial threshold_ + _retrial delay_ to mark nodes as unreachable
3. Decide what to do when depending on which and how many nodes are unreachable
    + e.g. prioritize consistency? prioritize availability?

### Implications

- More complex (and robust) design and implementation
- __Note__: this is useful also when reliable network protocols (e.g. TCP) are in place

---

## About Authorization and Authentication

### What

1. __Authentication__: letting the nodes of a DS _recognise_ and _distinguish_ themselves from one another
    + this includes _users' clients_ (a.k.a. identifying the legitimate users of the system)

2. __Authorization__: a server granting (or forbidding) access to resources depending on the identity / role of the _authenticated_ client

### Why

- __Access control__: to control who can (or cannot) do what
- __Monitoring__: to record who is doing what
- Prerequisite for many __cyber-security__-related aspects

### How

1. Allow the system to register _legitimate users_ and/or _roles_, endowing them with _credentials_
1. One or more server is in charge of generating _session tokens_ upon client _request_
1. Authenticated nodes _include_ session tokens in _any subsequent interaction_
1. Nodes know how to _verify_ session _tokens_ are __valid__ and _genuine_
1. Nodes _enforce_ access control depending on the _content of the token_

### Implications

- Requires one _authentication server_, possibly backed by a _database_
- Requires _cryptography_ to handle session tokens
- Requires _designing_ and _implementing_ some access control mechanism,
e.g. [ACLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list), [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control), etc.

---

## About Data Partitioning

### What

- _Clones_ of the same _functionality_ are deployed, each one covering a _partition_ of the _geographic region_ where the system operates
    + e.g. amazon**.uk** vs. amazon**.it**, google**.fr** vs. google*.com**, etc.
- Clones are _not consistent_ among each other, because data is _partitioned_ on a geographical basis
    + mechanisms are in place to _direct_ users towards _closest_ partition

### Why

- __Fault-tolerance__: one fault in one region does not propagate to others region
- __Availability__ and __Load-balancing__: divide-and-conquer approach to serve users
- It is sometimes a mandatory accomplishment due to regulations (cf. [GDPR, art. 44](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/it/44.htm))

### How

- The same infrastructure is deployed in different places
- Mechanisms may be present to connect the clones of the system (hence hiding partitioning to users)

### Implications

- Deployment procedures should be _reproducible_ and _parametric_, possibly _automated_
- Clones should be designed to be aware of the existence of other clones
